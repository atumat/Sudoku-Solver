A problem involving the placing of numbers using logic is called sudoku. The goal of traditional Sudoku is to fill a 9 by 9 grid with numbers so that each column, row, and each of the nine 3 x 3 subgrids that make up the grid include all digits from 1 to 9. The difficulty comes from the constraints the player must adhere to in order to fill the grid.



Rule 1: The digits 1 to 9 must appear exactly once in each row.




Rule 2: The numbers 1 to 9 must appear exactly once in each column.



Rule 3: Each block can only have one instance of the digitsÂ 




The soduko grid is represented using a two-dimensional array.The value 0 indicates a free cell whose value will be filled by the code.
